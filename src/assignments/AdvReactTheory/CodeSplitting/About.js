      About us Page!! - Demonstration of code splitting
      <p>
        Code splitting is basically splitting of code according to our need!

        <br />
        The only drawback about code splitting is that you can only use it in client side rendering.

        Both the above techniques wonâ€™t work during server side rendering when it comes to React .  This is the reason why the React team recommends using loadable components for code splitting in the server.
